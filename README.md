## What is Beatdrinks?
Beatdrinks represents a web service (REST API) using context-sensitive information about the user's mood to find the perfect combination of some music and a cocktail.

## How may I integrate Beatdrinks in my own projects?
(work in progress)

## Do I have to pay for the API Key?
Since Beatdrinks was developed during a study's module there has never been an idea to monetize our API.
So you are allowed to use it to make the world a better place. ;)
