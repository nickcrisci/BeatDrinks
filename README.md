## What is Beatdrinks?
Beatdrinks represents a web service (REST API) using context-sensitive information about the user's mood to find the perfect combination of some music and a cocktail.

## Do I have to pay for the API Key?
Since Beatdrinks was developed during a study's module there has never been an idea to monetize our API.
So you are allowed to use it to make the world a better place. ;)

## Where can I find more information about the working process? (interesting for examiner)
Aspects like our "proof of concept" are stored on several wiki pages.
You might consider to look at them since the "standard" repository is only a part of the entire project. 

## Versionlog
##### 0.0.0 : Pseudocode reveals initial goals
##### 1.0.0 : Beatdrinks allows the user to manage users and request cocktail track combinations based on a certain mood
